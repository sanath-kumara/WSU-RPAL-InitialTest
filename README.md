# WSU-RPAL-InitialTest
This repository contains a Python implementation of a maze-solving algorithm using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) technique. The program takes a maze image as input and computes the shortest path from a defined start point to an end point, while visualizing the exploration process and the final solution.

## **Setup Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python collections-extended
   ```

3. Ensure the maze image is placed in the repository folder as `maze.png`.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python mazeSolver.py
   ```
